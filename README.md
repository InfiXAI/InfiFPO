## üì£ News
* **[2025/05/17]**  üöÄ Source code released! We're now working on extending InfiFPO to more LLMs.

## üéØ Overview
We propose **InfiFPO**, a principled and efficient framework for performing model fusion during the preference alignment phase. Our key insight is that the reference model in preference optimization (e.g., in DPO) can be replaced with a fused source model, thereby enabling the pivot model to learn not only from preference data but also from the probabilistic behaviors of multiple source models.

Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that **InfiFPO** consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, **InfiFPO** improve its average performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Reallm-Labs/InfiFPO.git
cd InfiFPO
conda create -n infifpo python==3.10
conda activate infifpo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

Our training code is primarily based on the `dpo_trainer` from the [TRL library](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) by Hugging Face. Specifically, we reference the implementation in [dpo_trainer.py](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/trl/trainer/dpo_trainer.py).

- Check the `run.sh` file
- If you're using a SLURM cluster, check the `run-slurm.sh` file instead


## Supported Dataset Format

InfiFPO now supports datasets with the following structure and fields:

- **`chosen`**: The preferred response
- **`rejected`**: The non-preferred response

### Pre-calculated Log Probabilities

#### Pivot Model Metrics
- **`ref_chosen_logps`**: Log probabilities of the `chosen` response calculated by the pivot model
- **`ref_rejected_logps`**: Log probabilities of the `rejected` response calculated by the pivot model
- **`ref_mean_chosen_logps`**: Mean log probabilities of the `chosen` response calculated by the pivot model
- **`ref_mean_rejected_logps`**: Mean log probabilities of the `rejected` response calculated by the pivot model

#### Source Model Metrics
- **`fuse_chosen_logps`**: Log probabilities of the `chosen` response calculated by the source model
- **`fuse_rejected_logps`**: Log probabilities of the `rejected` response calculated by the source model
- **`fuse_mean_chosen_logps`**: Mean log probabilities of the `chosen` response calculated by the source model
- **`fuse_mean_rejected_logps`**: Mean log probabilities of the `rejected` response calculated by the source model
